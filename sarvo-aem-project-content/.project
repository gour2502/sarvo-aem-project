  <comment>A CQ content package containing the initial content used during the develop phase. By allowing developers to
        share content this way, it allows for easier testing during early development.

        Eventually, once the project progresses to QA and/or Production, this module should be deleted. At that point
        development envionments should be seeded with content created in QA and/or Production by creating content
        packages in those environments.

        During development, the files in this module should be sync&apos;d to your CQ instance using the FileVault command
        line tool available with CQ. There is also a plugin for Eclipse called &quot;vaultclipse&quot; that can be used instead
        of the command line tool. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
